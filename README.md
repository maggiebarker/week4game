jquery game

This is a simple math game that presents the user with a target number and four buttons that correspond with four unknown values. Clicking each button will add the value of that button to the running total.  If that total exceeds the target number, the round is lost and the next round begins. The value buttons will be assigned new values at the beginning of each round.

This game is styled entirely in HTML and vanilla CSS.  The game logic is powered by javascript and jquery.
